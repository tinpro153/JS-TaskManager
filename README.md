A full-stack Task Management System web application featuring robust user authentication (Register/Login/Logout) using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for session security. The system utilizes MongoDB/Mongoose for data management and provides full CRUD functionality for tasks, allowing classification by status (Pending, In Progress, Completed). Security is enhanced via Helmet/CORS and configuration managed by dotenv. Deployment target is Heroku/Docker.
